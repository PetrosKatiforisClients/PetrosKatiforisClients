Github is a proprietary and owned by Microsoft. If you're looking for a libre (free as in freedom software) you can check out codeberg.org or you can potentially host your very own gitea instance. Check out my [profile on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/petros_katiforis) to find out what I'm currently working on.
