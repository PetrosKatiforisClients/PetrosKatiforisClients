Github is proprietary and owned by Microsoft. If you're looking for a libre (free as in freedom software) alternative you can check out codeberg.org or you can potentially host your very own gitea instance. Check out my [codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/petros_katiforis) to find out what I'm actually working on right now.

> You can find some equally convenient and ethical alternatives all over the internet. Check out this site for more information: https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/
